# redbus

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the Cubesharp app:

1. Install Android Studio on your computer.
2. Clone this repository to your computer.
3. Open the project in Android Studio.
4. Select the Run/Debug Configuration for the app.
5. Choose the device or emulator to run the app on.
6. Click the Run button.

If you're running the app on an emulator, create an Android Virtual Device (AVD) first. Open the Android Studio Device Manager and click the Create Virtual Device button.

Once the app is running, interact with it just like any other Android app.

## Additional Notes:

- If you make changes to the app code, rebuild the app by clicking the Build menu and selecting Rebuild Project.
- If you encounter issues running the app, ensure you have the latest version of Android Studio installed and that the device or emulator is compatible with the app.
- Check the Android Studio logs for any errors.
